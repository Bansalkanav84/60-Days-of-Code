# 🧠 60 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **60 Days of Code** journey! 🚀  
Every day, I solve few coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), covering a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics. This repo documents my progress, solutions, and learnings along the way.

## 🛠️ Daily Structure

Each day has its own folder:

DayXX/  
├── Problem1.java  
├── Problem2.java  
├── Problem3.java  
└── README.md  

Each `README.md` file inside a `DayXX` folder contains:
- ✅ Problem titles
- 🔗 LeetCode links
- 🧩 Code solution links (in this repo)
